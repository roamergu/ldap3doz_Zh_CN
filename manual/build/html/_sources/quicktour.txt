Searching
---------

.. note::

   For more comprehensive information about searching, see the :doc:`SEARCH <searches>` documentation.

Search operation is enhanced with a few parameters:

* get_operational_attributes: when True retrieves the operational (system generated) attributes for each of the result
  entries.
* paged_size: if greater than 0 the server returns a simple paged search response with the number of entries specified
  (LDAP server must conform to RFC2696).
* paged_cookie: used for subsequent retrieval of additional entries in a simple paged search.
* paged_criticality: if True the search should fail if simple paged search is not available on the server else a full
  search is performed.

To search for a binary value you must use the RFC4515 escape ASCII sequence for each byte in the search assertion. You
can use the function *escape_bytes()* in ldap3.utils.conv for properly escape a bytes object::

    from ldap3.utils.conv import escape_bytes
    guid = b'\xca@\xf2k\x1d\x86\xcaL\xb7\xa2\xca@\xf2k\x1d\x86'
    search_filter = '(guid=' + escape_bytes(guid) + ')'
    c.search('o=test', search_filter, attributes=['guid'])

search_filter will contain *'(guid=\\ca\\40\\f2\\6b\\1d\\86\\ca\\4c\\b7\\a2\\ca\\40\\f2\\6b\\1d\\86)'*.

Raw values for the attributes retrieved are stored in the *raw_attributes* dictonary of the search result entries
in c.response. If the schema is read (with get_info=SCHEMA or get_info=ALL in the Server object) and the check_names
parameter of the Connection object is set to True, the *attributes* attribute is populated with the formatted values as
specified by the RFCs according to the schema syntaxes.

Custom formatters can be used to specify how an attribute value must be returned in the 'attributes' attribute of the
search entry object. A formatter must be a callable that receives a bytes value and returns an object. If the attribute
is defined in the schema as 'multi_value' the attribute value is returned as a list (even if only a single value is
present) else it's returned as a single value.

Formatted (following the schema and RFC indications) attributes are stored in the *attributes* dictionary of the search
result entries in c.response. This is performed only if the schema is read in the server object and the check_names
parameter is set to True else the undecoded value is returned.

Attributes key are case insensitive, this means that you can access c.response[0]['attributes']['postalAddress'] or
c.response[0]['attributes']['postaladdress'] and get the same values back.


Simple Paged search
-------------------

The search operation can perform a *simple paged search* as per RFC2696. You must specify the required number of entries
in each response set. After the first search you must send back the cookie you got with each response in each subsequent
search. If you send 0 as paged_size and a valid cookie the search operation referred by that cookie is abandoned.
The Cookie should be stored in connection.result['controls']['1.2.840.113556.1.4.319']['value']['cookie']; the server
may return an estimated total number of entries in
connection.result['controls']['1.2.840.113556.1.4.319']['value']['size']. You can change the paged_size in any
subsequent search request.

Example::

    from ldap3 import Server, Connection, SUBTREE
    total_entries = 0
    server = Server('test-server')
    c = Connection(server, user='username', password='password')
    c.search(search_base = 'o=test',
             search_filter = '(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)',
             search_scope = SUBTREE,
             attributes = ['cn', 'givenName'],
             paged_size = 5)
    total_entries += len(c.response)
    for entry in c.response:
        print(entry['dn'], entry['attributes])
    cookie = c.result['controls']['1.2.840.113556.1.4.319']['value']['cookie']
    while cookie:
        c.search(search_base = 'o=test',
                 search_filter = '(object_class=inetOrgPerson)',
                 search_scope = SUBTREE,
                 attributes = ['cn', 'givenName'],
                 paged_size = 5,
                 paged_cookie = cookie)
        total_entries += len(c.response)
        cookie = c.result['controls']['1.2.840.113556.1.4.319']['value']['cookie']
        for entry in c.response:
            print(entry['dn'], entry['attributes])
    print('Total entries retrieved:', total_entries)

If you don't want to deal directly with the cookie you can use the much simpler extended operations package that wraps
all the cookie machinery and hides implementation details, you can choose to get back a generator or the whole list of
entries found.


Working with a generator is better when you deal with very long list of entries or have memory issues::

    # generator
    total_entries = 0
    entry_generator = c.extend.standard.paged_search(search_base = 'o=test',
                                                     search_filter = '(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)',
                                                     search_scope = SUBTREE,
                                                     attributes = ['cn', 'givenName'],
                                                     paged_size = 5,
                                                     generator=True)
    for entry in entry_generator:
        total_entries += 1
        print(entry['dn'], entry['attributes])
    print('Total entries retrieved:', total_entries)

Remember that a generator can be consumed only one time, so you must elaborate the results in a sequential way.

Working with a list keeps all the found entries in a list and you can elaborate them in a random way::

    # whole result list
    entry_list = c.extend.standard.paged_search(search_base = 'o=test',
                                                search_filter = '(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)',
                                                search_scope = SUBTREE,
                                                attributes = ['cn', 'givenName'],
                                                paged_size = 5,
                                                generator=False)
    for entry in entry_list:
        print entry['attributes']
    total_entries = len(entry_list)
    print('Total entries retrieved:', total_entries)
