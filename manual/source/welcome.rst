ldap3 简介
#################

ldap3 是一个严格遵守RFC4510 LDAPV3标准的，纯python实现的库。整个ldap3已经完全从头编写，无论是使用Python 2, Python 3, PyPy, PyPy3 还是 Nuikta ，只要他们运行的系统能够通过Python解释器和Python标准库访问网络，ldap3就能在这些系统上正常运行。

ldap3 is a strictly RFC 4510 conforming LDAP v3 pure Python client library. The whole ldap3 library has been **written from scratch**
and the **same codebase works with Python 2, Python 3, PyPy, PyPy3 and Nuikta** on any system where it can gain access to
the network via a Python interpreter and the Python Standard Library.


授权
-------
ldap3库 是基于 **LGPL v3 license** (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html) 发布的开源软件，这意味着你可以使用ldap3开发任意应用，无论是私有软件还是开源软件，你也可以复制、分发和修改ldap3,修改后的ldap3的描述和授权要在LGPL协议下免费。基于ldap3的衍生库必须在LGPL下授权，但使用了ldap3的应用软件则不必如此
The ldap3 library is open source software released under the **LGPL v3 license** (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html).
This means that you can use the ldap3 library in any application (either open or proprietary). You can also copy, distribute and modify
the ldap3 library provided that modifications are described and licensed for free under LGPL.
Derivatives works of ldap3 can only be redistributed under LGPL, but applications that use the library don't have to be.


RFCs 
---------------

The ldap3 library strictly follows the latest (as of 2015) RFCs describing the LDAP v3 protocol:

* The **latest RFCs for LDAP v3** (dated 2006) obsolete the previous RFCs specified in RFC3377 (2251-2256, 2829, 2830, 3371) for LDAP v3 and amend and clarify the LDAP protocol.
* All the ASN1 definitions are written from scratch to be current with RFC 4511.

To avoid unnecessary server and network load caused by poor formed searches The ldap3 library deliberately doesn't
follow the specification in RFC4511 (4.5.1.8.1) that states that in a Search operation "an empty list with no attributes requests
the return of all user attributes.". Instead you must explicitly request the attributes you need or use the ldap3.ALL_ATTRIBUTES
value in the Search operation.

The library allows to send an empty member list while creating a GroupOfNames object, even if this is not allowed in the
official LDAP v3 schema.

ldap3 allows communication over Unix sockets (ldapi:// scheme, LDAP over IPC) even if this is not required by any official LDAP RFCs.


PEP8 Compliance
---------------

ldap3 is PEP8 compliant, except for line length. PEP8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the standard coding style
guide for the Python Standard Library and for many other Python projects. It provides a consistent way of writing code for maintainability
and readability following the principle that "software is more read then written".


Home Page
---------

The home page of the ldap3 project is https://github.com/cannatag/ldap3


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available at http://ldap3.readthedocs.org. You can download a PDF copy of the manual at https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/ldap3/stable/ldap3.pdf


Download
--------

The ldap3 package can be downloaded at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ldap3. If you use a package manager that support the *wheel* format
you can get the universal wheel package, and install it on any supported Python environment.


Install
-------

Install with **pip install ldap3**. If needed the library installs the ``pyasn1`` package. If you need Kerberos support you must
install the ``gssapi`` package. ldap3 includes a backport (from Python 3.4.3) of ssl.check_hostnames to use on older
(< 2.7.10) Python version. If you want to use a newer version of the check_hostnames feature you can
install the ``backports.ssl_check_hostnames`` package that should be kept updated by its author with the latest Python release.
